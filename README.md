## GEOS
This is a Haskell binding to Geos, the open-source geometry library. Capabilities include:

* Geometries: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection
* Predicates: Intersects, Touches, Disjoint, Crosses, Within, Contains, Overlaps, Equals, Covers
* Operations: Union, Distance, Intersection, Symmetric Difference, Convex Hull, Envelope, Buffer, Simplify, Polygon Assembly, Valid, Area, Length,
* Prepared geometries (pre-spatially indexed)
* STR spatial index
* OGC Well Known Text (WKT) and Well Known Binary (WKB) encoders and decoders. These can be used to parse PostGIS geometry types.
